## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Font Icons 

### What I learned

It took me forever to get the images to line up properly. Probably spent 10 minutes looking for the Huddle logo only to realise it was hidden  behind the mockup art images. I also tried a lot of different ways to make the font icons work before I tried using the script directly, which was a lot simpler and quicker than the ways I had been doing. It's another way of making the process more streamlined.

### Continued development

I'd like to start more projects that make use of the entire space rather than smaller components so I can get used to utilising responsive widths in the entirescreen.

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com) - This is my favourite site for font icons, I think. It's really easy to navigate and to style within the CSS.
